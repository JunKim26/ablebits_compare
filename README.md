# In this program, tkinter will be used to prompt a user to choose two CSV files. One file will contain the primary keys
# and another column with values for commparison. The second value will contain the values we are comparing with the first CSV file. 
# The resulting output file will contain only the rows that had a matching value and save to a folder with a timestamp.

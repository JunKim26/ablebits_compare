# Author: Jun Kim
# Date: 12/22/2021
# Description: This program is a variation of the compare_two_tables program. A tkinter will be used to prompt a user to choose a csv file to retrieve data from.
# The user will then be prompted to choose a second file to compare the email addresses from entries in the first file.
# If the email addresses match, respective IDs will be written in to the new file.
